# Home

Thanks for using mdsite! This is the homepage of your site, created from the file `index.md` in the `public_html` folder you copied.

## Getting started

* Edit `index.md` to change what's on your homepage.
* Make some new pages, which are just files ending in `.md`.
* Change the site title by editing `res/layout.htm` and changing `Site Title` to something better.
  Make sure you change it in both the `<title>` and the `<h1>`.
* If you know some HTML and CSS, change more of `layout.htm` to make the site unique.
  Feel free to replace or mess with `style.css`, or put some of your own stuff in `res/`.
